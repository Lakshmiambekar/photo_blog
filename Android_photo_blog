Set up a mobile application powered with Stream APIs. 
The application mimics an Instagram-style application 
where users can take photos, share them publicly, follow other users, 
see a notification feed and aggregated data along the way.
When the mobile app starts, users see a global feed,
which we recommend when you want a single activity feed of all activities of users.
The backend retrieves the data from Stream, does some manipulation to show likes on the photo, the author details, and 
sends that back to the mobile client. 
Firebase gives the tools to develop high-quality apps, grow user base, and earn more money. 
The essentials can monetize business and focus on users.
