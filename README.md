1.1 Introduction

Set up a mobile application powered with Stream APIs. The application mimics an Instagram-style application where users can take photos, share them publicly, follow other users, see a notification feed and aggregated data along the way.  When the mobile app starts, users see a global feed, which we recommend when you want a single activity feed of all activities of users. The backend retrieves the data from Stream, does some manipulation to show likes on the photo, the author details, and sends that back to the mobile client. Firebase gives the tools to develop high-quality apps, grow user base, and earn more money. The essentials can monetize business and focus on users.

1.2 Firebase
Firebase is considered as web application platform. It helps developers to builds high-quality apps. It stores the data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format which doesnâ€™t use  query for inserting, updating, deleting or adding data to it. It is the backend of a system that is used as a database for storing data. 

1.2.1 Firebase Analytics 
It provides insight into app usage. It is a paid app measurement solution that also provides user engagement. This unique feature enables the application developer to understand how users are using the application. The SDK has the feature of capturing events and properties on its own and also allows getting custom data.

1.1.2 Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) 
It  is formerly known  as Google Clouds  Messaging (GCM), FCM is a  paid service which is  a cross-platform solution for messages  and  notifications  for Android,  Web  Applications, 
and IOS. 

1.1.3 Firebase Auth  
Firebase Auth supports  social login provider  like Facebook, Google  GitHub,  and  Twitter.  It is  a  service  that  can authenticate users using only client-side code and it is a paid 
Service. It also includes a user management system whereby developers can enable user authentication with email and password login stored with Firebase. 

1.1.4 Real-time Database 
Firebase provides services like a real-time database and backend.  An  API  is  provided  to  the  application  developer which  allows  application  data  to  be  synchronized  across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud. The client libraries are provided by the company which enables integration with Android, IOS, and JavaScript applications. 

1.1.5 Firebase Storage 
It facilitates easy and secure file transfer regardless of network quality for the Firebase apps.  It is backed by Google Cloud Storage which is cost-effective object storage service.  The developer can use it to store images, audio, video, or other user-generated content. 

1.1.6 Firebase Test Lab for Android  
It provides cloud-based infrastructure for testing Android apps.  With one operation, developers  can initiate testing  of  their  apps  across  a  wide  variety  of  devices  and  device configurations.  The various test results like screenshots, videos and logs are available in the Firebase console... Even if a developer hasn't written any test code for their app, Test Lab can exercise the app automatically, looking for crashes. 

1.1.7 Firebase Crash Reporting 
The detailed reports of the errors are created in the app. The errors are grouped into clusters of similar stack traces and triaged by the severity. The other features are:  the developer can log custom events to help capture the steps leading up to a crash. 

1.1.8 Firebase Notifications 
It enables targeted user notifications for mobile app developers and the services are freely available.
